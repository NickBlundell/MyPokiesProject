## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

After implementation, monitor these metrics:

1. **Materialized View Refresh Time**
   ```sql
   SELECT check_name, details->>'refreshed_at', created_at
   FROM monitoring.health_check_history
   WHERE check_name = 'Materialized Views Refresh'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

2. **Dashboard Query Performance**
   ```sql
   SELECT queryid, mean_exec_time_ms, calls
   FROM monitoring.slow_queries
   WHERE query_preview LIKE '%mv_player%'
      OR query_preview LIKE '%mv_game%'
      OR query_preview LIKE '%mv_campaign%'
   ORDER BY mean_exec_time_ms DESC;
   ```

3. **Partial Index Usage**
   ```sql
   SELECT indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
   FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
   WHERE indexname LIKE '%status%'
   ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
   ```

4. **Database Health Trends**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       check_name,
       status,
       COUNT(*),
       MIN(created_at) AS first_occurrence,
       MAX(created_at) AS last_occurrence
   FROM monitoring.health_check_history
   WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
   GROUP BY check_name, status
   ORDER BY check_name, status;
   ```

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Production Deployment

1. **Test Materialized View Creation**
   ```sql
   -- Verify views were created
   SELECT matviewname, ispopulated
   FROM pg_matviews
   WHERE schemaname = 'public'
     AND matviewname LIKE 'mv_%';
   ```

2. **Test Health Monitoring**
   ```sql
   -- Run health check
   SELECT * FROM monitoring.health_check_summary();

   -- Verify no critical issues
   SELECT * FROM monitoring.check_and_alert()
   WHERE alert_level = 'CRITICAL';
   ```

3. **Test Partial Indexes**
   ```sql
   -- Verify indexes were created
   SELECT indexname, tablename
   FROM pg_indexes
   WHERE schemaname = 'public'
     AND indexname LIKE '%status%'
   ORDER BY tablename, indexname;
   ```

4. **Benchmark Query Performance**
   ```sql
   -- Before and after comparison
   EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
   SELECT * FROM mv_player_lifetime_value
   WHERE player_value_segment = 'VIP'
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Materialized View Refresh Failures

**Symptom:** Refresh function fails or takes too long

**Solutions:**
1. Check for long-running queries blocking refresh
2. Consider refreshing views separately if one is slow
3. Adjust refresh frequency if data freshness allows
4. Add more memory to database if needed

### High Memory Usage During Refresh

**Symptom:** Memory spikes during materialized view refresh

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh views at off-peak times
2. Use `work_mem` setting to control memory usage
3. Consider incremental refresh strategies for very large views
4. Split large views into smaller, more focused views

### Partial Index Not Being Used

**Symptom:** Query still doing sequential scans

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure query matches index WHERE clause exactly
2. Run `ANALYZE` on table to update statistics
3. Check if `enable_indexscan` is set to ON
4. Verify index was created with CONCURRENTLY successfully
